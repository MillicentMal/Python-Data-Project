# Graph guide for self-taught techies
This project was built in Python using different Python frameworks such as SpaCy to extract specific topics from  Udacity 
Syllabi for their Nanodegrees and then create a graph to show the path users would take to get the skills. 

# Running
The project has been deployed on Streamlit but can be run by:
1. running pip install -r requirements.txt
2. streamlit run app.py

#Files
The graph.py is where the natural language processing is done on the pdf files to extract the different topics or courses then store them in csv files

the app.py contains all the main code for building and displaying the graph
